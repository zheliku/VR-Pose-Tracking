This implementation uses a BroadcastChannel in the browser to communicate with your app, so Proxima must be running in the same browser as the Unity app.
- **Serializable Structs and Classes**: You can now view any struct or class marked as [Serializable] in the Proxima Inspector! Nested objects and arrays of objects are fully supported.
- **ProximaButton Attribute**: Add the [ProximaButton("Button Name")] attribute to MonoBehaviour methods to add a buttons in the Proxima inspector. Instructions at https://www.unityproxima.com/docs/buttons.
- **Deep Links**: New query parameters can be appended to the Proxima URL:
  - 'pass' - Automatically connect with the provided password.
  - 'page' - Navigate to page 'inspector', 'logs', or 'console' after connecting.
  - 'go' - Select a gameObject by name after connecting.
  - 's' - Set the search filter on the inspector page.
  - 'collapsed' - Collapse the navigation menu.
  - 'run' - Immediately run console command.
  - For examples, see: https://www.unityproxima.com/docs/deeplinks
- **Show Hidden Checkbox**: By default, Proxima respects hideFlags for GameObjects and Components. There is a new checkbox on the inspector page to show these hidden objects.
- **Start Screen**: Added a new start screen where you can view the latest changes, access documentation, and provide feedback.
